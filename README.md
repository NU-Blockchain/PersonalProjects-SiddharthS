This project creates an NFT minting platform. It has a REACT frontend and utilizes the wagmi and rainbowkit packages to connect to a metamask wallet for transactions. 
It employs a randomizer to generate an SVG NFT that is subsequently deployed and can be viewed on the OpenSea Market.
It used Hardhat for deployment.
To view the platform, run the following command (a blockchain has already been deployed with this code):
npm run start
The collection of NFTs can be viewed at:
